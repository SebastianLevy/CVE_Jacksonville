resize the sidebar images to be equal to the height of the original image and make the width proportional so that the ratios of the sidebar is the same

start with the "first_sidebar" = "first_sidebar.png" . once this is clicked, transition to instructions ("instructions.png")

once a specific area is clicked on instructions (the part under the line), proceed to "analytics.png"

once on "analytics.png", use opencv to draw the numbers that are changing (like what sebastian did.. should be able to work for scaife rn)


** for sake of getting the flow of UI working, it is fine to just do it on cafe image
