1) Area Segmentation - Lifen



2) Status Detection - Sebastian



3) YOLO - Sebastian


4) Live Occupancy: The Live Occupancy portion of the provided code focuses on real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. Utilizing the 'yolov8s.pt' file, the YOLO model processes frames captured from a video source, identifying individuals classified as "person" within the scene. The code visualizes these detections by drawing bounding boxes around detected people, labeling them as "person," and marking the key bottom-midpoint with circle. Additionally, the code defines and displays different areas that are drawn by the user using polygons and labels. The user is provided with a real-time view of detected individuals and their spatial distribution within the specified regions. The program allows for easy observation of live occupancy dynamics and is terminated upon user input (pressing the 'Esc' key), ensuring an interactive and informative experience.


6) 5 UI - Alexis
